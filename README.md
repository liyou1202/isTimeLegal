## Create an App to Check if a Given Time is Within a Specified Range

### Application Requirements:

- Develop a native mobile application in Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, or Java.

- The application should check if a specified time falls within a given time range.

- Accept an input of a specific time and a time range (start time and end time).

- Represent time as integers (e.g., 6 for 6:00).

- The specified time range should include the start time but exclude the end time.

- If the start time and end time are the same, consider it as inclusive.

- Handle cases where the start time is later than the end time (e.g., start time: 22, end time: 5).

- Save the results on the device, including start time, end time, input time, and the determination result.

- Provide the ability to view a list of results.

- Ensure compatibility with iOS 12 or later and Android 6.0 or later.

- Prioritize readability, maintainability, and extensibility in the code.
